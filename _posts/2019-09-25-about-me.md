### About Me
I'm Hannah Beaumont, and I don't really know what I'm doing...  
As well as studying Computer Science at A-Level, I am also studying Maths, Further Maths, and BTEC Dance.

### My Computing History
I did Computer Science at GCSE and (somehow) achieved a grade 9 (A**).
In the past I have programmed in python, which was pretty easy to be honest.
I'd say I'm fairly confident with python, eventhough I'm cluless about pretty much everything most of the time.
